                        The first drag balls began at Harlem's Hamilton Lodge in 1869. Ball culture, drag ball culture, or house-ballroom culture describe an underground LGBTQ+ subculture that originated in the United States, in which people "walk" (i.e., compete) for trophies, prizes, and glory at events known as balls. Ball participants are mainly young Black and Latinx members of the LGBTQ+ community. Attendees can spectate, dance, vogue, and/or walk in one or more of the numerous drag categories that are designed to emulate other genders and social classes, while offering a sort of escape from reality. This culture extends beyond the extravagant events as most participants in ball culture belong to groups known as "houses" that mimic a family structure and offer similar support.

                        Despite their growing popularity, drag balls were deemed illegal and immoral by mainstream society. A moral reform organization known as the Committee of Fourteen periodically investigated the balls. In 1916, the committee released a report detailing the scandalous behavior they witnessed. The report described a scene filled with "phenomenal" "male perverts" in expensive frocks and wigs, looking like women. The committee later released 130 reports describing its visits, demanding that such perversion must desist.

Their first event was called "Crystal & Lottie LaBeija presents the first annual House of Labeija Ball at Up the Downstairs Case on West 115th Street & 5th Avenue in Harlem, NY." This event was thought to be the birth of house culture as it is known today. Houses serve as alternative families, primarily for gay, gender nonconforming and transgender youth and others who feel ostracized from conventional support systems.

                        Paris Is Burning, an American documentary film directed by Jennie Livingston, was released in 1990. Filmed in the mid-to-late 1980s, it chronicled the ball culture of New York City and the Black, Latinx, gay, and transgender communities involved in it. Some critics considered the film to be an invaluable documentary of the end of the "Golden Age" of New York City drag balls, and an exploration of race, class, gender, and sexuality in America.
